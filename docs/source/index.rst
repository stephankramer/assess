Welcome to Assess's documentation!
==================================

Assess is a python package that implements a number of analytical solutions,
in cylindrical and spherical shell domains, to the Stokes equations

.. math:

   -\nabla\cdot\vec \tau + \nabla p = -g\rho'\hat{\vec r},

   \vec \tau &= \nu\left[\nabla\vec u + \nabla{\vec u}^T\right], \\
   \nabla\cdot\vec u &= 0,

where :math:`\vec u` is ...

.. math:

   a = 123

or does it?
